# Callbacks

Hey everyone! Thanks for sitting through today's lecture ðŸ˜Š

Today we talked about using callbacks! The basic idea was that we can pass functions around without invoking them, so that "higher order functions" can use them as they please. We used this concept to make functions that are *generic*. Now... the notes that I have here are all the bits and pieces of code that we wrote during lecture. However, if you want some good solid definitions I really recommend taking a look at Joel's excellent notes: https://web.compass.lighthouselabs.ca/activities/185/lectures/1716

I also recommend KV's notes and examples: https://web.compass.lighthouselabs.ca/activities/185/lectures/1554

Take a look through the different files in this repo, and message me if you have any questions or need anything cleared up.

Topics we covered:

- Functions are values - CHECK!
- What are anonymous functions? - CHECK
- Function declaration vs. Function expression - CHECK AS WELL
- Function calling vs. passing (reference) - CHECK
  - HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS - ALSO CHEEEECK

- Implementing our own versions of some popular functions (e.g. forEach)

- BY THE WAY, I recommend if you have time over the course of bootcamp, make a habit of implementing your OWN versions of functions that ALREADY exist.


- Try making functions that accept more than one callback???
  - What?? Yeah, that's a thing

Enjoy!

Cheers,
