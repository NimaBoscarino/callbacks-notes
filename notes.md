# W 1 D 4: Callbacks

Goals:

- Functions are values
- What are anonymous functions? (example)
- Function declaration vs function expression
- Function calling vs passing 
- Callback functions and Higher order functions
	- Definition
	- Why they exist
- Implementing our own forEach and our own backwards


## Functions

Takes parameters (0 or many) and provides you with an output.


Imagine I have a function that takes two numbers and gives back the sum.

- RETURN


Function: getAllThePlayers()
Output of the function: A list of the players

Function: addTwoNumbers(a, b)
Output of the function: The sum of a and b


You know how strings are values?
You know how booleans are values?
Functions are values as well.

"Callback" in a nutshell:

- A function that's passed to another function in a parameter.
- That "receiving" function can call the other function.


Callbacks are used in all sorts of places.

"Callbacks are not a thing."

- for loops are a thing
- functions are a thing
- if statements are a thing
- callbacks are a PATTERN
